# InlineMapping
An experiment to use a source generator to generate object mapping code. Note that if you build the code locally, you'll need to build in `Release` mode for the package reference in `InlineMapping.NuGetHost` to resolve correctly (or unload that project from the solution as it's optional and delete `nuget.config`).
